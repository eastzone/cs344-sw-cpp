--------
BUILDING
--------

autotools is used as the build system. Unfortunately, the toolchain version on
myth may be to old; use the ee108-*b machines.

To build in VNS mode:

  % make clean
  % make all

To build in NetFPGA mode:

  % make clean
  % make all OPTS='--enable-cpumode'

To build in NetFPGA mode for the reference bitfile (probably unnecessary):

  % make clean
  % make all OPTS='--enable-cpumode --enable-ref-reg-defines'

To force re-execution of autotools' configure script on the next build:

  % make deep-clean

-------
TESTING
-------

To run the googletest unit test suite, run:

  % make check
